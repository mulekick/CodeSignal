# Codefight solutions repository

I've solved a lot of problems featured on **CodeSignal.com**. I will use this repository to store, organize and manage all the code I've produced while doing so.

## Up until now, all the solutions are written in Javascript

This may change in the future.

## Contents

I will include all the solutions I've written for :

1. Arcade Mode
2. User submitted challenges
3. Company bots challenges
4. Quick challenges

Please note that for each solution you'll find 2 files bearing the same name, with different extensions :

- a *.js file containing the code of the solution
- a *.pdf file containing the description of the problem.

The above does not apply to the quick challenges. For these, problem description will be added as a commentary in the *.js file.

## You can be sure that

1. All the arcade mode solutions are correct and have passed all visible and hidden tests 
2. All the user submitted challenges solutions are correct and scored 300/300
3. All the company bots challenges solutions are correct and all scored 300/300 except Codefights round 3 and Kikbot round 1 (which have nevertheless beaten the bots)
4. All the quick challenges solutions are correct and have passed all visible and hidden tests 
5. All the solutions are written with respect to the challenge's core technical matter (for instance, solutions to bitwise-related challenges are written using bitwise operations, not string conversion and array manipulation)
