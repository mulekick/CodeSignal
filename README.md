# Codefight solutions repository

I've solved a lot of problems featured on **Codefights.com**. I will use this repository to store, organize and manage all the code I've produced while doing so.

## As of now, all the solutions are written in Javascript

This may change in the future.

## Contents

I will include all the solutions I've written for :

1. Arcade Mode
2. User submitted challenges
3. Company bots challenges

Please note that for each solution you'll find 2 files bearing the same name, with different extensions :

- a *.js file containing the code of the solution
- a *.pdf file containing the description of the problem.
